## What is Tx3?

Tx3 is a domain-specific language designed specifically for describing transaction templates in UTxO-based blockchains. It helps you:

- Define clear interfaces for your dapps
- Describe transaction patterns
- Generate concrete transactions
- Visualize transaction flows
- Ensure transaction safety

## Why Tx3?

In UTxO-based blockchains like Cardano, dapps are defined by transaction patterns rather than explicit function interfaces. This makes it challenging for:

- Dapp authors to convey their dapp's interface
- Users to understand how to interact with dapps
- Developers to build tools that work with dapps

Tx3 solves these challenges by providing a language specifically designed for describing transaction patterns and generating interfaces.
